MatLab code to analyze the structural strength of beam bridge designs.
Calculates the following:
- Shear Force Envelopes
- Bending Moment Envelopes
- Flextural Stresses
- Shear Stress
- Thin Plate Buckling limts

The script also calculates the Factors of Safety for all the above mentioned applied stresses and capacities. 
The Factors of Safety are used to find the theoritical limit of the bridges loading capacity and predict the cause of failure when the limit is reached.

Follow the comments in the code to customize the geometric properties, loading conditions, material stress capacities, etc.
